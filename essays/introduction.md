*Going into university, I never planned to major in Management Information Systems.*

When I was in high school, my mother suggested I took a STEM related course as one of my electives. Initially, I did not like the idea of this as I was afraid of trying something new. The STEM course I took was actually similar to a coding class. The first week of school seemed overwhelming and scary from all the assignments, guidelines, and expectations of the class. However, over time I started to like coding. In my first year, I learned coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Needless to say, I took all 4 years of different coding classes throughout high school.

Upon entering university, I originally applied to be a Computer Science major but I had a change of heart before the semester even began. I wanted to explore beyond just the technology aspect of computer science. I wanted to do more. As a result, this prompted me to research of other potential majors which led me to Management Information Systems (MIS). I liked that MIS offered both sides of business and computer science into one major. I asked my advisors if I could change my major to MIS but because of this switch, I had a long road ahead of me. I spent several semesters completing my Shidler admission requirements to get to where I am now.

As of now I am excited for ITM 352 and for the future. I want to learn more about what MIS has to offer through this course. I look forward to learning a lot!
